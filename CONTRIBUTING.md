# Contributing

All contributions are welcome.

Take a look at the [Main Board] and see if there is anything in the `To do` column which you would
like to work on. The highest priority issues are at the top.

You may also look for any issues that are labeled with [help wanted].

Just because an issue does not have the [help wanted] label does not mean that help is not
appreciated just double check with someone before picking it up.

Add a comment to the ticket to say that you are working on the issue and we will assign it to you
and update the relevant boards.

## Verified Commits

Make sure that you sign all your commits. See [Github - Signing Commits] for more details.

## Testing

All bug fixes should first have a test which demonstrates the bug. You should commit the failing
test before fixing it so reviewers can see that the test is doing what it is supposed to.

### Unit Tests

Run `test` for regular unit tests.

### Plugin Tests

Run `scripted` for scripted plugin tests.

## Versioning

Version numbers are determined automatically using [dwijnand/sbt-dynver].

To create a new version add a new git annotated tag:
```bash
git tag -as v1.1.0
```

> ⚠️ The tag must be annotated (`-a`) and signed (`-s`).

## Continuous Integration

Continuous integration builds can be found in [Travis CI].

## Publishing

The Travis CI build will automatically publish to [Bintray] and [GitHub] for all tagged commits on
master.

### Signed Artifacts

The published artifacts are signed with key belonging to [BotTech]. These are not
available in forks. Reach out to us if there are any issues with this.

### Bintray

This uses [sbt/sbt-bintray] to publish artifacts to Bintray and [ohnosequences/sbt-github-release]
to publish to GitHub.
